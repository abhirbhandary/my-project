Langchain for PDFs
The application utilizes the capabilities of language models and embeddings to perform conversational retrieval, enabling users to ask questions and receive relevant answers from the PDF content.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an application that can interact with users and provide answers from a PDF documents. The application uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand user queries and retrieve relevant information from the PDFs. By incorporating OpenAI and Hugging Face models, the application leverages powerful language models and embeddings to enhance its conversational abilities and improve the accuracy of responses.
